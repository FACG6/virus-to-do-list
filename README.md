## Why?
We build To-do list app to help users enter and organize their tasks/data.


## What?
* This app enables disorganised people to add to do-items.
* This app enables users to view their to-dos, mark them as completed or not completed. 
* This app enables users to remove to-dos when they are done. 
* The app sorts to-do items. Incomplete to-dos will appear at first, then complete ones.


## How?

1. We divided the tasks between our team. 
2. We created a repo and raised an issue for the file structure.
    * logic.jss: we worked in pairs to solve the functions and test them.
    * dom.js: Each pair works on a section in the dom. 
    * We improved the style of the app together.
3. In the end, we tested the coverage percentage of our app and we found some useless functions. We deleted them!


## Main Skills We Learned:

1. Pure functions.
2. TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT.
